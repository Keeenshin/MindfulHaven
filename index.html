        <h2>Things to Do When Feeling Stressed</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Deep Breathing</h3>
                <p>Practicing deep breathing helps calm your nervous system, reduces stress hormones, and promotes relaxation. By focusing on slow, deep breaths, you can activate the body's relaxation response, lower your heart rate, and reduce blood pressure. This practice can also enhance oxygen exchange, improve concentration, and increase feelings of tranquility.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Exercise</h3>
                <p>Physical activity increases endorphins, which are natural mood lifters. It also helps to distract your mind from worries. Regular exercise can improve your overall mental health by reducing anxiety, depression, and negative mood. Additionally, it enhances self-esteem and cognitive function, and helps in maintaining a healthy sleep pattern.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Meditation</h3>
                <p>Meditation encourages a state of relaxation and mindfulness, helping to clear your mind and reduce stress. By focusing on the present moment, it can reduce rumination and negative thoughts. Consistent meditation practice can improve emotional regulation, enhance self-awareness, and increase patience and tolerance. It also has been shown to lower stress levels and improve overall well-being.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Listening to Music</h3>
                <p>Music can have a profound effect on your emotions. Listening to your favorite tunes can help you relax and elevate your mood. Music therapy is known to reduce stress and anxiety, improve mood, and enhance cognitive function. The rhythmic and repetitive aspects of music engage the neocortex of the brain, which calms the mind and reduces impulsivity.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Talking to Someone</h3>
                <p>Sharing your feelings with a friend or family member can provide emotional support and reduce feelings of isolation. This social interaction can foster a sense of belonging, increase feelings of security, and improve mood. Talking things out can help you gain perspective on your problems, find solutions, and feel validated and understood.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Journaling</h3>
                <p>Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process emotions and gain clarity. Journaling can be a powerful tool for self-reflection and personal growth. It helps in identifying and addressing negative thoughts and behaviors, tracking progress over time, and setting and achieving goals. Additionally, it can serve as a stress reliever by providing an outlet for expressing emotions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Going for a Walk</h3>
                <p>Walking, especially in nature, can help you disconnect from stressors and provide a mental break. Walking stimulates the release of endorphins, which improve mood and reduce stress. The act of walking can also enhance creativity, improve focus and concentration, and promote better sleep. Being in nature adds the benefits of fresh air, sunlight, and natural scenery, which can further elevate your mood and overall sense of well-being.</p>
